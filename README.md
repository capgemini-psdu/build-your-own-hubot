# PSD2obot

PSD2obot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot].

### Running PSD2obot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](scripts.md#configuration) they rely upon have been set.


You can start PSD2obot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    PSD2obot>

Then you can interact with PSD2obot by typing `PSD2obot help`.

    PSD2obot> PSD2obot help
    PSD2obot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    PSD2obot help - Displays all of the help commands that PSD2obot knows about.
    ...

### Scripts

More detail about scripting and which scripts are included with PSD2obot can be found in the [scripts](scripts.md) documentation.

##  Persistence

PSD2obot uses the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested). This defaults to a [Redis][Redis] instance which is required to run on its default port 6379.

If you are testing locally and don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`
from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.

## Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on, such
as Campfire or IRC. There are a number of third party adapters that the
community have contributed. Check [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the
available ones.

If you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add
the adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the
`dependencies` section.

Once you've added the dependency with `npm install --save` to install it you
can then run hubot with the adapter.

    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>

Where `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.

## Slack Adaptor

PSD2obot is configured to use the Slack Adaptor.

> (Extract taken from [Slack API][slackapi] guide.)

You will need to set up a Custom Bot on your Slack team. This will create a token that your hubot can use to log into your team as a bot. Visit the [Custom Bot creation page][custom-slackbot] to register your bot with your Slack team, and to retrieve a new bot token.

Once youâ€™ve got your bot set up as you like, you can run your hubot with the run script included (being sure to copy-and-paste your token in!):

    % HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE ./bin/hubot --adapter slack

## Deploying to AWS

This section describes to manual process to set this up. We will automate this process at some point.

### Set up the necessary AWS infra

#### Create a virtual machine

A t2.micro EC2 instance running AWS Linux is sufficient.


#### Prepare the EC2 instance to run your application

First we need to install the main dependencies: git, npm and redis. SSH to the machine, install git:

    % yum install git

Create a new SSH key pair and add the public key to your GitHub account in the usual way.

Next install npm. See https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ for details about node and the AWS documentation http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html for details of how to do this on AWS Linux.

The download and installation of Redis as a service has been automated and can be completed by the following commands:

    % wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yenkeecg/b00edfcc3476fb6d208eb5546b874673/raw/install-redis.sh
    % chmod 777 install-redis.sh
    % ./install-redis.sh

### Deploying the application

You should now be able to pull the project code and run the application:

    % git clone git@github.com:capgemini-psdu/build-your-own-hubot.git
    % cd build-your-own-hubot
    % npm install
    % HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE ./bin/hubot --adapter slack


### Deploying to UNIX or Windows

    The default Hubot documentation comes with a link with vague instructions about how to deploy to a UNIX operating system.
    Please check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix]  wiki page if you would like more information.
